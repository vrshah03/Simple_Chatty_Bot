# Simple_Chatty_Bot
This was my second project on Jet Brain's academy in which I have learned about the concepts of Python.

Here, i have work on simple bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers. The test should be a multiple-choice quiz about programming. Bot has to repeat the test until you answer correctly and congratulate you upon completion.

I get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

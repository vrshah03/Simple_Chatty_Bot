# Simple_Chatty_Bot
This was my second project on Jet Brain's academy in which I have learned about the concepts of Python.

Here, at the beginning of programmerâ€™s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own.

I get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
